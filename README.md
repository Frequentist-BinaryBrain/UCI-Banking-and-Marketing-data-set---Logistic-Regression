# UCI-Banking-and-Marketing-data-set---Logistic-Regression


A Portuguese banking firm ran direct marketing campaigns on their existing clients via phone calls. The clients were asked whether or not they would be interested in subscribing to the bank’s term deposit. Their responses were recorded, and a data set was created that included information about the clients’ personal and financial information.
Based on this information, you need to predict if a certain client who is yet to be contacted would be willing to subscribe to the bank’s term deposit.
